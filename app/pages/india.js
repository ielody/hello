<h2>Varanasi</h2>
  <img src="/img/image-41941.jpeg" alt="People along Ganges in Varanasi">
<p>Varanasi is everything I had imagined about India in one and the same city - what a colorful chaos! Varanasi is the city of the Ganges flows through and pilgrims come here every year to cleanse themselves with a bath in the river. The city is the oldest inhabited city in India and in the many streets along the river in the old city, life unfolds undisturbed in front of those who want to see. <br><br>At some of the gates, the rich and famous are cremated in the traditional way, on a small bonfire, before the body is sent out on the water. The old town is a maze of narrow streets to get lost in, but luckily it is easy to find your way back by walking down to the river bank. The best time is like elsewhere in India, best before everyone gets up, at sunrise.<br><br> The first morning in Varanasi, I walked down to the ghetto by my guesthouse, past one of the funeral ghats, where the smoke from the fire was still visible. My first stop was at a man who was selling chai out of a big pot. Right next to him sat two orange-clad monks enjoying the sun with a cup of chai. Furthermore, I walked past the main square, where the day before there had been so many people, scents, colors and music. By the high walls and steps that led down to the river, there were freshly washed sheets from the guesthouses in the streets. Despite its hectic exterior that sets all the senses in motion, Varanasi is a spiritual place with a kind of inner peace in all the chaos.</p>

<h2>Fort Kochi</h2>

<p>There is a big difference in India's many regions, and Kerala in the south is one of the most modern. Just a short ferry ride across the water from the city of Kochi is Fort Kochi. This was originally a fishing village, something you see again today along the waterfront where the old-fashioned fishing nets are stretched out ready for use. At sunrise we went for a walk along the promenade, where at dawn there is already fresh fish for sale in small stalls, the chai is already made in large pots and small baked goods to be enjoyed hot with a small cup of chai in hand. As I curiously stood scurrying across the water towards the fishing nets and the fishermen this morning, I received a wave, a nod and a smile as an invitation to join and go fishing with the six fishermen. Afterwards, with our stomachs full of chai and good street food, we rented bikes for 1 dollar a day and cycled to a small part of Kerala backwaters, where we ended up renting a boat from some local fishermen before the trip went to a banana plantation and a local beach. In the evening, it was time for a traditional performance, a spectacular performance of Kathikali, where the actors are painted in strong colors with beautiful, colorful costumes and a love story is played out using dance and storytelling. Fort Kochi is European and Indian culture in beautiful combination with beautiful nature.</p>

<h2>Munnar</h2>
<img src="/img/munnar3.jpeg" alt="Tea plantations in Munnar in India">
<p>Munnar is a six-hour bus ride from Kochi, and is a mountain village surrounded by tea plantations, lakes and beautiful scenery. Already on the way up in the mountains, the view of lush forests, waterfalls and endless tea plantations was truly spectacular. Munnar also has wild elephants, monkeys, and tigers and it is also said that black panthers roam around the area. We hired a tuk-tuk driver for the day, who took us to a lookout point in the mountains on the border with Tamil Nadu to enjoy the view of the West Ghat mountain range, an area rich in a variety of animal species, flora and fauna. On the way back we met one of the giants of the jungle up close, when we from the tuk-tuken saw three elephants standing and grazing in the forest to the right of the road. The driver stopped along the road so we could take pictures, and fearlessly I moved into the jungle towards the elephants. On the other hand, I quickly realized that I had gone too far when one of the elephants had enough and started running towards us. Before the trip was over, we drove past a lake on the way for ice cream and to watch the wild monkeys in the trees. I am eternally grateful that I got to experience Munnar's beautiful nature, unique wildlife and huge tea plantations.</p>
